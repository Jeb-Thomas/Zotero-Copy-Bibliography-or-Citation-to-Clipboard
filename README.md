# Zotero-Copy-Bibliography-or-Citation-to-Clipboard
This is an extension for Zotero that will copy the citation or bibliography to your clipboard

This extension was created due to the built in Zotero Copy Citation and Copy Bibliography not working the way I expected.

# To Install
Download the code and zip the contents. Make sure that you zip the contents of the source folder and not the source folder itself.

# To Use
Ctrl+Shift+B -> copy bibliography of selected items to your clipboard
Ctrl+Shift+V -> copy citations of selected items to your clipboard

# To Edit
edit Zotero-Copy-Bibliography-or-Citation-to-Clipboard\content\zotero-copy-bib-to-clipboard.js
